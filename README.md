Connects to BitCoin node and prints out all outgoing/incoming messages. Finds a given block number and prints out the transactions within the block. There is an experiment at the end where we change the value of a block.

`bitcoin_bytes.py` is a helper module for serializing and deserializing bytes in order to construct messages per the BitCoin messaging protocol.
